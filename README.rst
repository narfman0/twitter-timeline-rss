Ingest a twitter timeline and render as RSS. This python web app is a service
to ingest arbitrary user's timelines as rss feeds, so you don't have to go
to twitter manually to read through quips and witticisms. Takes username as
parameter for any timeline.

Usage
=====

Install requirements::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Change directory into twitter_timeline_rss and run flask server::

    cd twitter_timeline_rss

Hit the endpoint with something like this url in your favorite browser::

CLI
